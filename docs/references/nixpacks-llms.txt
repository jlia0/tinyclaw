Nixpacks Reference (for LLM context)
======================================

TinyClaw does not currently use Nixpacks for deployment.  The primary
deployment methods are:

1. Cargo build from source (cargo build --release -p tinyclaw).
2. Pre-built binaries from GitHub Actions artifacts.
3. systemd / launchd / NSSM service installation via `tinyclaw install-service`.
4. Android APK (manual build via Android Studio or Gradle CLI).

If Nixpacks support is added in the future, the build plan should:
- Install Rust stable toolchain.
- Run `cargo build --release -p tinyclaw`.
- Copy the binary to the output directory.
- Set the start command to `./tinyclaw start`.

No Node.js runtime is needed for the Rust build (the legacy TypeScript in
src/ requires Node.js but is not the primary build path).

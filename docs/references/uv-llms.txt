UV / Python Reference (for LLM context)
=========================================

TinyClaw is a Rust project and does not use Python or uv.

If Python tooling is ever needed (e.g., for model conversion scripts or
benchmarking), prefer uv for virtual environment and dependency management:

    uv venv .venv
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt

No Python code exists in the repository today.
